# Cryptor
 This is a mini-cryptor program that I've made !

# How to Crypt
<p>It is very simple just launch the Chupapi Cryptor.exe</p>
<p>type : 1 </p>
<p>And it will automatically generate 2 files (filename.crypt, filename.crypted)</p>

# How to Decrypt
<p> If you want to decrypt a file you should have the filename.crypt and filename.crypted in the same path as the Chupapi Cryptor.exe </p> 
<p> When it's done just relaunch the Chupapi Cryptor.exe</p>
<p>type: 2 </p>
<p>In the filename argument you should type filename.crypted to refer to the .crypted file </p>
<p>And then you're done your file back ;)</p>
